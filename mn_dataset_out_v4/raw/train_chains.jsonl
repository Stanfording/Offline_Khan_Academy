You've grasped the core idea of balance and careful isolation. ‚ú® So, why is this balance so important in solving equations?\n\nThink of an equation like a perfectly balanced scale. ‚öñÔ∏è Whatever you do to one side, you *must* do to the other to keep it from tipping over! If we add 5 to one side, we need to add 5 to the other. If we divide one side by 2, we must divide the other by 2 as well. This keeps the equality true.\n\nLet's look at a simple example: `2x + 3 = 7`.\n\nFirst, we want to get the term with 'x' by itself. What's currently with `2x` that we can move?\n\n"}}, {"command": "ui_mcq", "parameters": {"question_text": "In `2x + 3 = 7`, what should we do first to isolate `2x`?", "options": ["Subtract 3 from both sides", "Add 3 to both sides", "Divide both sides by 3"], "variable_name": "q_step1_isolate"}}]}, "reason": ""}
