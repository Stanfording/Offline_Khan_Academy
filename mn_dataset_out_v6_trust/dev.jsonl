Let's start with a little magic trick to get our minds warmed up. ‚ú®\n\nImagine you have a special plant that doubles its size every day. On day 1, it's 1 unit tall. On day 2, it's 2 units tall. On day 3, it's 4 units tall. How tall would it be on day 5? ü§î\n\nIt's like saying 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2, or 1 multiplied by 2, five times! We can write this super neatly using exponents: 2‚Åµ. The little '5' is called an exponent, and it tells us how many times to multiply the base number (which is 2 here) by itself. Pretty neat, right?"}}, {"command": "ui_short_answer", "parameters": {"question_text": "In your own words, what's the main idea of an exponent?", "variable_name": "initial_paraphrase", "placeholder": "My understanding is..."}}]}, "meta": {"seed_kind": "chain_step_0", "domain": "Math", "grade": "9th", "topic": "Exponents & Radicals", "chain_id": "chain-fde68510f4"}}
