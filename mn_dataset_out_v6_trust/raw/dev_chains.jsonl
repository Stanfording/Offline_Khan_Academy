If you wanted soda, maybe 'B2'. The 'A1' and 'B2' are like the parameters telling the vending machine *which* snack to dispense. ü§î\n\nSo, what do you think is the main idea of a function with parameters?"}}, {"command": "ui_short_answer", "parameters": {"question_text": "In your own words, what's the main idea here? ü§î", "variable_name": "initial_paraphrase", "placeholder": "My understanding is..."}}]}, "reason": ""}

You've grasped the essence. ‚ú® Now, let's dive into the 'main lesson' part of functions and parameters. \n\nThink of a function like a recipe. üç≥ It's a set of instructions to perform a specific task. For example, a `make_cake` function would have steps like 'mix ingredients', 'bake', 'decorate'. \n\nNow, what if you want to make different kinds of cakes? You don't want a whole new recipe each time, right? This is where **parameters** come in! \n\nParameters are like special ingredients or instructions you give *to* the function. They allow the function to be flexible and do slightly different things. \n\nFor instance, in our `make_cake` function, we could have parameters like `flavor` (e.g., 'chocolate', 'vanilla') or `size` (e.g., 'small', 'large'). \n\nSo, why do we use parameters? ü§î They make our functions reusable and adaptable! Instead of writing a new function for every flavor of cake, we can use one `make_cake` function with a `flavor` parameter. \n\nLet's check your understanding: If you have a `greet` function that takes a `name` parameter, what would happen if you called `greet('Alice')`?

Plus, we can use the same function multiple times without rewriting the code. Saves time and effort! üöÄ\n\nLet's look at a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n```\n\nHere, `greet` is our function. But what‚Äôs `name` inside the parentheses? ü§î\n\nThat‚Äôs where **parameters** come in! A parameter is like a placeholder for a value that the function needs to do its job. It‚Äôs the ingredient we pass into our recipe.\n\nWhen we *call* the function and give it an actual value, like `greet(\"Alice\")`, that value \"Alice\" is called an **argument**.

Then, whenever you want a cake, you just follow that recipe. \n\nWhy do we use functions? Well, they help us organize our code, making it easier to read, debug, and reuse. \n\nNow, let's consider **parameters**. What are they for? ü§î Parameters are like placeholders for information that a function needs to do its job. \n\nImagine our cake recipe again. It might have a parameter for 'number of servings'.
