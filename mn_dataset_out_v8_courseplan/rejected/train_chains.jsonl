Think of them like tiny spinning tops! üí´\\n\\n*   **Aligned spins:** When most of these electron \"tops\" spin in the same direction, they create a strong push or pull ‚Äì that's magnetism! This makes materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt **ferromagnetic**. They are the superstars of magnetism! üåü\\n*   **Random spins:** In most other materials, the electron \"tops\" spin all over the place. They cancel each other out, so there's no overall push or pull. That's why your wooden pencil doesn't stick to the fridge! ‚úèÔ∏è\\n\\nSo, why do magnets only attract certain things?\\n\\nWell, magnets have two special ends called **poles**: a North pole and a South pole. These poles are where the magnetic force is strongest. It's like they have two personalities! üòÑ\\n\\n*   **Opposites attract:** A North pole will always pull towards a South pole. Imagine them giving each other a big hug! ü§ó\\n*   **Likes repel:** If you try to push two North poles together, or two South poles, they'll push away! It's like they're saying, \\\"Nope, not today!\\\" üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n\\nThis attraction and repulsion is what we call the **magnetic force**. It's an invisible force, but we can definitely see its effects!\\n\\nJust to check, which of these poles attract each other?\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"command\": \"ui_mcq\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"question_text\": \"Which poles attract each other?\",\n        \"options\": [\n          \"North and North\",\n          \"South and South\",\n          \"North and South\"\n        ],\n        \"variable_name\": \"mid_lesson_check\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}}
