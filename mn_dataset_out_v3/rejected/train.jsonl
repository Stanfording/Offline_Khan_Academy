Boolean logic is all about these two states and how we combine them.\\n\\n*   **TRUE (1):** The switch is ON.\\n*   **FALSE (0):** The switch is OFF.\\n\\nWe use special operators to connect these states:\\n\\n1.  **AND ( $\\land$ ):** Both sides must be TRUE for the whole thing to be TRUE. \\n    *   *Analogy:* You get dessert *if* you eat your veggies AND you finish your homework. 🍎📚➡️🍰\\n2.  **OR ( $\\lor$ ):** At least one side must be TRUE for the whole thing to be TRUE. \\n    *   *Analogy:* You can play outside *if* it's sunny OR it's not raining. ☀️🌧️\\n3.  **NOT ( $\\neg$ ):** It flips the state. If it's TRUE, it becomes FALSE, and vice-versa.\\n    *   *Analogy:* If it's NOT raining, you can go out. 🚫🌧️\\n\\nLet's check your understanding.
