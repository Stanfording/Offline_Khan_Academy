If we have no gold gems, it's like a '0'. \n\nNow, think about how we count. We use digits 0 through 9. But what if we run out of digits? We group them! For example, after 9, we have 10. That's like saying 'one group of ten and zero ones'. \n\nComputers are like that chest – they only understand 0s and 1s (binary!). Hexadecimal (or hex) is just another way to group these 0s and 1s to make them easier for us humans to read.
