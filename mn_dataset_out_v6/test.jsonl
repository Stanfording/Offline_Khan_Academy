In computer science, especially when we're debugging (which means finding and fixing problems in our instructions, like a detective üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), we often talk about **balance**. When our computer program's instructions aren't quite right, it's like a recipe that's missing an ingredient or has too much sugar. Why does balance matter? Because if one part of our instructions is wrong, the whole thing might not work as expected! Think of it like building with blocks ‚Äì if one block is wobbly, the tower might fall. We need to make sure our 'instructions' are balanced and correct."}}, {"command": "ui_mcq", "parameters": {"question_text": "When debugging, what's the main goal when our computer instructions aren't working?", "options": ["Add more colors to the screen", "Find and fix problems", "Make the computer faster"], "variable_name": "mid_lesson_check"}}]}, "meta": {"seed_kind": "chain_step_1", "domain": "Computer Science", "grade": "3rd", "topic": "Debugging Strategies", "chain_id": "chain-f1e8e98635"}}
