What does that mean?\n\n*   **High-level:** It means Python is designed to be human-readable, with syntax similar to English. This makes it easier to write and understand compared to low-level languages like Assembly.\n*   **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand. This allows for quicker development cycles and easier debugging.\n\nThink of it like this: a low-level language is like speaking directly to your computer's core components, which is powerful but complex. Python is like having a very helpful translator who speaks your language and tells the computer exactly what to do in a way it understands.\n\nSo, why is Python so popular?\n\nü§î **Why might a language be popular?**\n\nIt's often because it's versatile, has a large community, and is relatively easy to learn.
