The meeting point is the vertex, and the roads are the rays forming the angle. \n*   **Think about it:** Why do we even care about angles? ü§î Well, they help us describe shapes, measure turns, and understand the world around us ‚Äì from the tilt of the Earth to the way a ramp slopes! \n\nHere's a quick check:"}}, {"command": "ui_mcq", "parameters": {"question_text": "What is the common endpoint of two rays forming an angle called?", "options": ["A.
